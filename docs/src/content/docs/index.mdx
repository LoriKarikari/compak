## Meet Compak

Compak is a package manager for Docker Compose applications. We believe deploying multi-container applications should be as simple as installing a package â€” no copy-pasting compose files, no manual configuration, just `compak install`.

Inspired by Homebrew's simplicity and powered by OCI registries, compak fills the gap between raw Docker Compose and full orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

## Your First Package

Get started in minutes. Install compak and deploy your first application:

  <TabItem label="Install Compak" icon="rocket">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoriKarikari/compak/main/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Deploy a Package" icon="puzzle">
    ```bash
    compak install immich --set DB_PASSWORD=secure123
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Check Status" icon="approve-check">
    ```bash
    compak status immich
    # immich-server    running   Up 2 minutes
    # immich-postgres  running   Up 2 minutes
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. Your self-hosted photo backup is running. Open `http://localhost:2283` and start uploading photos.
